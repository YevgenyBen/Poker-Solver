# Poker Solver

A Texas Hold'em GTO solver engine, coupled with a webview so a user can explore
its output interactively.

## v1 scope

- Engine: Python (NumPy for hot paths).
- Preflop only — RFI / 3-bet / 4-bet / jam ranges for a chosen effective stack
  depth. No board cards, no postflop streets (yet).
- Heads-up (2 players) only, not multiway.
- CFR+ solver over a 169-starting-hand-class abstraction (single bet size per
  street, 4-raise cap before forced jam-or-fold).
- Backend: FastAPI (`GET /solve/{stack_bb}`), on-demand solve with an
  in-process cache + startup pre-warm of common stack depths.
- Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite) in `frontend/`. `npm run dev` for a
  hot-reloading dev server (proxies `/solve` to FastAPI on :8000);
  `npm run build` produces `frontend/dist/`, which `api/main.py` serves
  directly at `/` when present. See `frontend/README.md`.

Full postflop support is out of scope for v1 but the module boundaries (e.g.
an injected `payoff_fn` at terminal tree nodes) are meant to allow adding it
later without a rewrite.

## v2 progress (in progress)

Growing toward a full-table, any-street advisor — see the roadmap plan for
the phased approach. Landed so far:

- **M8 — N-player generalization (multiway preflop), validated at 3-handed.**
  `game_tree.py`, `equity.py`, and `cfr.py` are now N-player-general, not
  hardcoded to 2. Heads-up keeps the original exact, deterministic CFR+
  solver as a fast path (`cfr.solve`); 3+ players use External-Sampling
  MCCFR (`cfr.mccfr_solve`) with a lazy, memoized multiway equity cache
  (`equity.MultiwayEquityCache`) — a full N-way equity table is never
  precomputed eagerly, since it's combinatorially infeasible past N=2.
  `solver.solve_preflop` dispatches between the two paths automatically
  based on `GameConfig.positions`'s length.
  - **Known, load-bearing tuning detail:** MCCFR's opponent-action sampling
    intentionally does *not* use an importance-sampling correction — see
    `EXPLORATION_EPSILON`'s docstring in `poker_solver/cfr.py` for why an
    earlier (textbook-unbiased) version of this was reverted after it was
    found to compound multiplicatively across nested opponent decisions at
    N=3, causing high-variance value estimates that CFR+'s regret flooring
    turned actively destructive. Don't reintroduce it without re-reading
    that writeup.
  - **Scope limit, by design:** the API's 3-max demo (`GET
    /solve/{stack_bb}?players=3`) solves over a small curated 8-hand subset
    (`api/main.py`'s `DEMO_MULTIWAY_HANDS`), not the full 169 classes — a
    full 169-hand 3-max MCCFR solve was measured to take well over 10
    minutes even at a modest iteration count, not viable for an interactive
    endpoint. Scaling this up is M9's job.
  - **Frontend:** a table-size toggle (heads-up / 3-max demo) and, in 3-max
    mode, a position selector (BTN/SB/BB) — see `TableModeControl.tsx`. The
    3-max grid is deliberately sparse (only the curated 8 hands are colored,
    the rest gray) since it's a demo, not a full range chart.
- **M9 — scale multiway preflop to 6-max/full ring.** Not started yet.

## Engine is standalone

`poker_solver/` has zero dependency on the API or any web framework — it's a
plain library usable on its own (`import poker_solver; poker_solver.solve_preflop(...)`).
This is enforced, not just true by convention: `tests/test_package_boundary.py`
scans every file under `poker_solver/` and fails the build if it ever imports
`fastapi`, `starlette`, `uvicorn`, or `api`. `api/` depends on `poker_solver`,
never the reverse.

Dependencies are split accordingly:
- `requirements.txt` — the engine only (`numpy`). `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  is enough to use `poker_solver` standalone.
- `requirements-api.txt` — adds the FastAPI backend (`-r requirements.txt` + `fastapi` + `uvicorn`).
- `requirements-dev.txt` — everything needed to run the full test suite (`-r requirements-api.txt` + `pytest` + `httpx2`).

## Workflow rules

- **Always work on a branch.** Never commit directly to `main`. Create a
  feature branch for every change, however small, and only merge into `main`
  when the user explicitly says to merge.
- **Tests are mandatory.** Every function gets a test.
  - Python: follow the `tests/` + pytest convention (one test module per
    source module, e.g. `poker_solver/foo.py` -> `tests/test_foo.py`).
  - Frontend: Vitest + React Testing Library, colocated as `*.test.ts(x)`
    next to the file it tests (e.g. `frontend/src/hands.ts` ->
    `frontend/src/hands.test.ts`).
- **Re-run the full suite after every change** — `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
  and, for anything under `frontend/`, `npm test` there too — before
  considering any change done, not just the tests for the file just touched.
- Ship one coherent improvement per PR (matches how this project started:
  scaffold -> missing-test PR -> merge).
