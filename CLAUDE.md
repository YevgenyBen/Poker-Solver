# Poker Solver

A Texas Hold'em GTO solver engine, coupled with a webview so a user can explore
its output interactively.

## v1 scope

- Engine: Python (NumPy for hot paths).
- Preflop only — RFI / 3-bet / 4-bet / jam ranges for a chosen effective stack
  depth. No board cards, no postflop streets (yet).
- Heads-up (2 players) only, not multiway.
- CFR+ solver over a 169-starting-hand-class abstraction (single bet size per
  street, 4-raise cap before forced jam-or-fold).
- Backend: FastAPI (`GET /solve/{stack_bb}`), on-demand solve with an
  in-process cache + startup pre-warm of common stack depths.
- Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite) in `frontend/`. `npm run dev` for a
  hot-reloading dev server (proxies `/solve` to FastAPI on :8000);
  `npm run build` produces `frontend/dist/`, which `api/main.py` serves
  directly at `/` when present. See `frontend/README.md`.

Full postflop support is out of scope for v1 but the module boundaries (e.g.
an injected `payoff_fn` at terminal tree nodes) are meant to allow adding it
later without a rewrite.

## v2 progress (in progress)

Growing toward a full-table, any-street advisor — see the roadmap plan for
the phased approach. Landed so far:

- **M8 — N-player generalization (multiway preflop), validated at 3-handed.**
  `game_tree.py`, `equity.py`, and `cfr.py` are now N-player-general, not
  hardcoded to 2. Heads-up keeps the original exact, deterministic CFR+
  solver as a fast path (`cfr.solve`); 3+ players use External-Sampling
  MCCFR (`cfr.mccfr_solve`) with a lazy, memoized multiway equity cache
  (`equity.MultiwayEquityCache`) — a full N-way equity table is never
  precomputed eagerly, since it's combinatorially infeasible past N=2.
  `solver.solve_preflop` dispatches between the two paths automatically
  based on `GameConfig.positions`'s length.
  - **Known, load-bearing tuning detail:** MCCFR's opponent-action sampling
    intentionally does *not* use an importance-sampling correction — see
    `EXPLORATION_EPSILON`'s docstring in `poker_solver/cfr.py` for why an
    earlier (textbook-unbiased) version of this was reverted after it was
    found to compound multiplicatively across nested opponent decisions at
    N=3, causing high-variance value estimates that CFR+'s regret flooring
    turned actively destructive. Don't reintroduce it without re-reading
    that writeup.
  - **Scope limit, by design:** the API's 3-max demo (`GET
    /solve/{stack_bb}?players=3`) solves over a small curated 8-hand subset
    (`api/main.py`'s `DEMO_MULTIWAY_HANDS`), not the full 169 classes — a
    full 169-hand 3-max MCCFR solve was measured to take well over 10
    minutes even at a modest iteration count, not viable for an interactive
    endpoint. Scaling this up is M9's job.
  - **Frontend:** a table-size toggle (heads-up / 3-max demo) and, in 3-max
    mode, a position selector (BTN/SB/BB) — see `TableModeControl.tsx`. The
    3-max grid is deliberately sparse (only the curated 8 hands are colored,
    the rest gray) since it's a demo, not a full range chart.
- **M9 — scale multiway preflop to 6-max/full ring.**
  - **Two real bottlenecks found and fixed, neither of which was "just turn
    the dial up" as the plan hoped:**
    1. *Eager tree construction.* `build_game_tree` used to build the whole
       tree upfront — fine at N<=3, but every raise re-opens the round for
       every remaining live player, so tree size grows combinatorially with
       both player count and `max_raises` (measured: ~333K terminals for
       6-max, ~8.7M for 9-max at just 3 raises, tens of millions at the
       default 4). Fixed via `game_tree.LazyChildren` — a `DecisionNode`'s
       `children` now builds (and memoizes) each child only when actually
       accessed, so solving pays only for nodes it visits, not the whole
       combinatorial tree. `walk`/`count_terminal_nodes`/`tree_depth` still
       fully materialize a tree when called (that's their point), just not
       during normal solving.
    2. *Equity computation cost.* Even with a lazy tree, MCCFR at N>=6 was
       still impractically slow — profiling traced it to
       `equity.MultiwayEquityCache`: it caches by the *exact* opponent-hand
       tuple, and that cache's hit rate collapses as opponent count grows
       (the space of possible tuples is roughly `hand_pool_size^opponent_count`
       — small enough to reuse heavily at 3-max's 2 opponents, far too large
       at 9-max's 8 for a hit to be likely). Fixed two ways: (a)
       `hand_eval.best_hand_rank_batch` — a NumPy-vectorized hand evaluator
       (kept alongside the original scalar `best_hand_rank`/`rank_five` as
       the trusted reference; cross-validated against it, not independently
       trusted) that batches many (hand, sampled-board) rankings into one
       computation instead of one Python call each; (b)
       `MultiwayEquityCache.traverser_equity_vector` now deals its fixed
       opponents' cards once and reuses that across every candidate hand,
       instead of re-dealing the same opponents from scratch per candidate.
       Together: ~7x faster per cache-miss computation at 9-max, and 6-max's
       *cache-hit rate* also improved enough that a 30K-iteration 6-max
       solve now runs in ~2.5 minutes. 9-max's cache-miss rate stays high
       regardless of raw speed (that's the nature of the combinatorial
       problem, not something more optimization alone fixes), so it ships
       with a much smaller iteration budget and correspondingly noisier
       output — a real, measured tradeoff, not a hidden shortcut.
  - **Iteration budgets, by table size** (`api/main.py`'s
    `MULTIWAY_TABLE_CONFIGS`, same numbers `test_solver.py`'s
    `six_max_result`/`nine_max_result` fixtures validate): 3-max 100K
    (unchanged from M8), 6-max 30K (tight convergence, ~2.5 min), 9-max 300
    (real MCCFR, but noisier — per-iteration cost at 9-max proved too
    variable to safely budget a large count for a live endpoint, so this is
    a much smaller, empirically-verified-reliable count, ~1.5 min; only
    AA's fold rate is asserted tightly in tests, not the full hand set the
    way 6-max's is).
  - **Frontend:** `TableModeControl` now offers heads-up / 3-max / 6-max /
    9-max, each with its own position list (`hands.ts`'s
    `MULTIWAY_POSITIONS`, keyed by table size — UTG through BB at 9-max).
    Switching table size defaults to *that size's* first-to-act position
    (UTG at 6/9-max, not a hardcoded BTN) — an early version of this got
    that wrong, caught by a frontend test asserting the actual position
    list, not just that a position selector rendered.

### Phase C — Postflop (in progress)

Design pass completed (see the roadmap plan) with two confirmed direction
calls: postflop moves to concrete two-card **combos**, not the 169-class
abstraction (blocker effects are a first-order postflop concern, unlike
preflop); and the first milestone targets a **flop-only** tree (runouts
averaged at the terminal) before building the chance-node machinery multi-
street chaining needs.

- **M10 — Combo representation + board-aware equity.**
  - `poker_solver/combos.py` — `HandCombo` (a concrete two-card hand,
    order-normalized so equality/hashing don't depend on construction
    order — a real bug here, a classic swap-without-a-temp-variable
    mistake in `__post_init__`, was caught by `test_combos.py` before it
    ever shipped), `all_combos`/`combos_for_class` (reusing `equity.py`'s
    `_suit_pairs_for`, not reinventing suit enumeration), and
    `range_from_class_frequencies` — the bridge from a preflop solve's
    per-class continue-frequency into a postflop range.
  - `poker_solver/board_equity.py` — `build_board_equity_table`, a
    board-aware N×N combo equity table (kept in its own module, not
    folded into `equity.py`, specifically to avoid a circular import
    with `combos.py`). Reuses `hand_eval.best_hand_rank_batch`, batching
    across Monte Carlo runout samples within one matchup. **Measured,
    not assumed:** ~O(N²) in combo count (a 23-combo range built in
    ~1.1s, a 78-combo range in ~18.7s) — fine for the small-to-moderate
    curated ranges this milestone and the next one actually use, would
    take tens of minutes at the full ~1176-combo scale a wide range
    could reach. Fully batching across matchups (not just within one)
    is the natural next step if/when a milestone needs that scale — not
    done yet since nothing does.
  - `poker_solver/cards.py` gained `parse_cards` (a shared "AhKh"/
    "Ts9h2c"-style parser used by `HandCombo.from_str` and the API layer).
  - **Frontend/API:** `GET /equity?hand_a=...&hand_b=...&board=...` — no
    CFR, no caching needed (a single matchup is fast enough to compute
    live), and a standalone equity-calculator UI section below the main
    range grid. Verified live: preflop AA vs KK ≈ 82/18, and on a
    `2c7d9h` board AA's equity rises to ≈ 90/10 (sensible — a dry,
    unpaired board that doesn't help KK). One real bug caught by live
    verification (not by tests): `frontend/vite.config.ts`'s dev proxy
    only forwarded `/solve`, so `/equity` silently fell through to
    Vite's SPA-fallback `index.html` instead of reaching FastAPI —
    fixed by adding `/equity` to the proxy list.
- **M11 — Flop-only game tree + exact CFR solve.**
  - `poker_solver/game_tree.py` — new `StreetConfig` (positions, entering
    `pot`, remaining `stack_bb`, `raise_sizes`, `max_raises` — no blinds,
    no `positions[-2]`/`[-1]` posting semantics, unlike `GameConfig`) and
    `build_street_tree`, reusing `_build` almost unchanged via two small
    shared abstractions added to both configs: `open_size_reference`
    (what the *first* raise is sized off — `big_blind` for `GameConfig`,
    `pot` for `StreetConfig`) and `pot_offset` (the entering pot not
    attributable to any tracked position's `invested`, which starts at 0
    fresh each street — 0.0 for `GameConfig`, `self.pot` for
    `StreetConfig`). One real, documented consequence:
    `TerminalNode.payoff()`'s "always zero-sum" guarantee only holds for
    `pot_offset=0` (preflop) — a postflop street's payoffs correctly sum
    to `pot_offset`, not 0 (the entering pot was already at stake, not
    contributed this street). Confirmed via `grep` that `.payoff()` is
    never actually called by the real solving code (`cfr.py` reads
    `node.pot`/`node.invested` directly), so this was a documentation/
    test-correctness fix, not a solving-correctness one.
  - `poker_solver/cfr.py` — `solve()` gained optional `positions` (default
    `(BTN, BB)`, unchanged) and `initial_reach` params, letting the same
    exact-tensor fast path serve a flop tree (`positions=("OOP","IP")`,
    real ranges as `initial_reach`) with zero new solving code. Internal
    helpers renamed from BTN/BB-specific to generic (`reach_a`/`reach_b`,
    `position_a`/`position_b`). `initial_reach`'s fallback to each hand's
    `combo_weight` is computed lazily, only for a position actually
    missing from `initial_reach` — needed since `combos.HandCombo` (M11's
    hand type) has no `combo_weight` at all, unlike `StartingHand`, and
    `solve_flop` always supplies both positions' real reach anyway.
  - `poker_solver/solver.py` — new `solve_flop(board, hero_range,
    villain_range, pot, effective_stack_bb, ...)`. Hero's and villain's
    ranges are combined into one shared combo pool (required by
    `cfr.solve()`'s single-`hands`/NxN-`equity_table` design); some
    (hero-combo, villain-combo) pairs in that pool inevitably share a
    physical card, which `build_board_equity_table` correctly reports as
    NaN — replaced with a neutral 0.5 before solving, the same "ignore
    blockers between players' hands" approximation the project has
    carried since M1, now also visible at combo (not just class)
    granularity.
  - **Directional sanity, verified, not assumed:** a hero range that's
    purely polarized (nuts + air, nothing in between) can legitimately
    bet/shove *both* extremes at similar rates under real Nash
    equilibrium — confirmed empirically while writing M11's tests, not a
    bug. The robust "value continues, air folds" check instead lives one
    node deeper: facing a bet, a real made hand (top pair + a straight
    draw) folds far less than complete air, at a realistic (not
    deep-stacked-overbet) stack-to-pot ratio — deep stacks relative to
    the pot were measured to collapse *any* hand's facing-a-shove
    decision to "fold almost always," regardless of relative strength,
    which is a real pot-odds fact, not a solver defect, but the wrong
    scenario to assert directional sanity in.
  - **Frontend/API:** `GET /solve_flop?board=...&pot=...&stack_bb=...&
    position=...` — a curated demo hero/villain range, expressed as small
    *hand-class* sets (`DEMO_FLOP_HERO_CLASSES`/`DEMO_FLOP_VILLAIN_CLASSES`,
    unlike `DEMO_MULTIWAY_HANDS`'s fixed combo pool) expanded per-request
    into board-legal combos via `combos.range_from_class_frequencies` —
    necessary since which combos a fixed pool would even mean varies with
    what the board itself blocks. Measured, not assumed: ~2.6s end to end
    for this pool size (3 hero / 4 villain classes, ~30ish combos after
    expansion), dominated by `board_equity`'s table build (~2.5s), not the
    CFR solve (~0.2s) — fine for a live request, cached per (board, pot,
    stack_bb, iterations) the same way multiway solves are cached per
    (stack_bb, players). `FlopSolver.tsx` — a board/pot/stack/position
    form and a sorted per-combo strategy list (not `RangeGrid`'s 169-cell
    layout — a flop combo range is a much smaller, variable-size,
    board-dependent set, ill-suited to that fixed grid).
- **M12 — Flop→turn chance-node chaining.**
  - `poker_solver/chance.py` (new) — `ChanceNode`/`ChanceBranch` +
    `build_chance_node`: takes a showdown-eligible flop terminal (action
    capped, nobody folded) and turns it into one branch per undealt card,
    each with its own board-specific equity table and its own real
    turn-street betting-round tree (`game_tree.build_street_tree`,
    unmodified). `game_tree.py` itself stays completely untouched —
    chance dispatch lives entirely in `cfr.py`'s recursion, fulfilling
    that module's own docstring promise to stay card-agnostic and
    sidestepping a fight with `LazyChildren`'s immutable, lazily-built
    design (pre-walking the tree to attach chance nodes would undo the
    laziness M9 built it for). Only chains flop→turn, one street — the
    river still uses M11's existing trick (averaged inside the turn
    branch's own equity table) one street further out; turn→river
    chaining is mechanically the same machinery, deliberately left for a
    future milestone, same "prove it small first" scope M9's iteration
    budgets and M10/M11's cost write-ups established.
  - **A real bug caught during design, not code review:** an initial
    sketch threaded `chance_fn` unconditionally through every recursive
    call, including inside a chance branch's own turn-street subtree —
    which would let a turn-level showdown terminal re-trigger the
    *flop*-scoped `chance_fn` and deal a "5th street" card off the wrong
    (3-card) board. Fixed by making chance dispatch a per-branch
    on/off switch (`ChanceBranch.chance_fn`, always `None` in M12) rather
    than an ambient one — `cfr._solve_recurse` uses `branch.chance_fn`
    when recursing into a branch, not the parent's — so a turn terminal
    correctly falls through to its (already river-averaged) equity table
    instead of dealing again. Covered by a dedicated regression test
    (`test_solve_does_not_recurse_chance_fn_into_branch_subtrees`) that
    would fail if this were ever threaded through unconditionally again.
  - `poker_solver/cfr.py` — `_solve_recurse`/`solve()` gained optional
    `chance_fn`/`chance_data` params (both default `None`, every M1–M11
    call site unaffected — verified by full-suite rerun, not just
    reasoning). A `ChanceNode`'s value is the *uniform* average of its
    branches' value matrices; no `InfoSetTable`/regret update happens at
    a chance node itself (not a decision point). `chance_data` is
    caller-suppliable and memoizes each distinct showdown terminal's
    built `ChanceNode` across all iterations (built once, not once per
    iteration) — also what lets a caller walk
    `chance_data[id(terminal)].branches[card].root` into a specific next
    card's subtree afterward.
  - `poker_solver/board_equity.py` — `build_board_equity_table` now
    resolves `remaining_needed == 1` (a turn board, only the river left)
    *exactly* (enumerating all ~44-46 possible rivers), not Monte Carlo
    sampled like `remaining_needed >= 2` still is — cheaper and
    noise-free, and load-bearing for M12 since every chance-branch table
    it builds is exactly this case. `_remaining_deck`'s enumeration was
    promoted to a shared `cards.remaining_deck`, reused by both this
    module and `chance.py` rather than duplicated a third time.
  - `poker_solver/solver.py` — new `solve_flop_turn(board, hero_range,
    villain_range, pot, effective_stack_bb, ...)`, mirroring `solve_flop`
    but wiring a `chance_fn` into `solve()` so every showdown-eligible
    flop terminal chains into a real turn tree. `StrategyResult` gained a
    `chance_data` field (empty `{}` for every pre-M12 result).
    `raise_sizes`/`max_raises` apply to both flop and turn streets — one
    deliberate scope cut, not a separate turn-specific sizing menu.
  - **The new approximation, sized precisely, not hand-waved:** chance
    branches get uniform weight (1 / undealt-card count) regardless of
    which cards either player's range already holds — `remaining_deck`
    only excludes the board, not hole cards, so for any combo, exactly 2
    of the ~47 branches deal a card that combo physically holds; its
    equity table correctly reports 0.5 there, but reach weight still
    contributes to the uniform average over that impossible branch. A
    real, small, precisely-bounded bias (~4.3% of branches per combo,
    deterministic given the combo, non-compounding across iterations,
    nets toward neutral rather than a wrong extreme) — distinct from,
    not a restatement of, the project's existing cross-*player*
    NaN→0.5 blocker precedent (`solve_flop`, `MultiwayEquityCache`),
    which is about two different players' hands conflicting, not one
    hand conflicting with the very card being dealt to decide its own
    equity. Fixable later via per-branch reach masking + renormalization;
    out of scope here to keep this one coherent improvement.
  - **Measured, not assumed — and this is why M12 ships engine + tests
    only, no API/frontend slice:** `build_chance_node` alone, at a tiny
    2-combo pool, builds its ~49 branch tables in ~0.05–0.3s (the
    exact-turn-board fix above is what makes this cheap — cross-checked
    against M10's flop-level 23-combo/~1.1s number). But a flop tree can
    have several distinct showdown terminals, each needing its own
    ~49-table chance node, and the cost is genuinely O(N²) in combo-pool
    size (same shape board_equity.py's own module comment already
    flags): at `solve_flop`'s actual demo scale (`DEMO_FLOP_HERO_CLASSES`/
    `DEMO_FLOP_VILLAIN_CLASSES` expanded to ~33 combos, default
    `max_raises=4`), a real measurement came back at **~183 seconds for
    just 50 iterations** (7 distinct chance nodes) — nowhere close to
    viable for a live, on-demand-solved endpoint. Same honesty M9 applied
    to 9-max's smaller iteration budget rather than pretending a slow
    path is fast: `/solve_flop_turn` and a frontend section are deferred
    to a follow-up milestone, not shipped speculatively slow. At the
    tiny fixture scale tests actually use (2 combos, `max_raises=1`), a
    full `solve_flop_turn` runs in ~2.5–3.3s for 20–100 iterations —
    fine for the test suite.
- **M13 — Turn→river chance-node chaining.**
  - `poker_solver/chance.py` — `build_chance_node` gained one new
    parameter, `chain_to_river: bool = False` (default preserves M12's
    exact behavior for every existing call site/test). When `True`, a
    branch whose own street still has real betting left (`remaining_stack
    > 0`) *and* whose own board isn't already a complete 5-card river
    gets its `chance_fn` populated with a closure that deals *that*
    branch's next card the same way — passing `chain_to_river=True` on a
    flop terminal therefore chains flop→turn→river, not just flop→turn,
    since the recursive call keeps forwarding the flag. This is the last
    chance-node hop possible starting from a 3-card flop: a complete
    river board has no cards left to deal. No changes to `cfr.py` or to
    `ChanceBranch`/`ChanceNode`'s shape were needed — see below.
  - **A correctness pitfall, prevented structurally, not just tested
    for:** an all-in-already branch (`remaining_stack == 0`, `root` reused
    as `terminal`) must never get a populated `chance_fn` — its own
    equity table (built one card richer than the calling board) already
    correctly averages over however many community cards remain via
    `board_equity.py`'s own `remaining_needed` handling, so a second
    explicit chance dispatch on top of that would double-process the same
    physical terminal against two inconsistent runout distributions, a
    real equilibrium-correctness bug, not just wasted work. Fixed by
    setting `chance_fn = None` *inside the same `if remaining_stack == 0`
    branch that already decides `root = terminal`* — the same `if/else`,
    not two independently-maintained decisions that could drift apart —
    rather than a separate identity check applied after the fact.
    Covered by a dedicated regression test at both the `chance.py` level
    (direct `build_chance_node` calls) and the `solver.py` level (the
    same guard holding through the real `solve_flop_to_river` call path,
    using this milestone's own tiny fixture's naturally-occurring
    all-in-at-the-flop line).
  - **A second, independent pitfall, also caught and covered:** each
    branch's river-dealing closure captures its own board/remaining-stack
    via default-argument binding (`lambda t, _b=next_board,
    _s=remaining_stack: ...`), not a bare closure over the loop variables
    — without it, every branch's closure would share the *last* loop
    iteration's board/stack by reference (Python's closure late-binding
    behavior), so every branch would silently deal its river off the
    wrong board once actually invoked. Regression-tested by invoking two
    different branches' own closures and confirming they deal from
    different, correctly-excluded card sets.
  - `poker_solver/solver.py` — new `solve_flop_to_river(...)`, identical
    to `solve_flop_turn` except its `chance_fn` closure passes
    `chain_to_river=True`. No `StrategyResult` field changes:
    `chance_data` (added in M12) is already generic, and traced (not
    assumed) to end up flat but two levels deep — `cfr._solve_recurse`
    forwards the same `chance_data` dict object unchanged at every
    recursion depth, so a turn-level showdown terminal's own chance
    dispatch memoizes into the *same* dict a flop-level one does, keyed
    by its own `id()`. Reaching the river level from a result is the
    identical one-hop-further pattern:
    `chance_data[id(some_turn_terminal)].branches[some_river_card].root`.
    Confirmed with a dedicated `cfr.py` test that hand-builds a chance
    node nested two levels deep (pure dataclasses, no `chance.py`
    involved) and checks both levels land in one dict — proving `cfr.py`
    needed zero changes, not just asserting it.
  - **Measured, not assumed:** the tiny fixture (same one `solve_flop_
    turn` uses — 1 hero combo × 1 villain combo, `max_raises=1`) runs a
    full `solve_flop_to_river` in ~4.3s at 20 iterations — fine for the
    test suite, so `DEFAULT_FLOP_TO_RIVER_ITERATIONS` is kept at 20
    rather than mirroring `DEFAULT_FLOP_TURN_ITERATIONS`'s 200 (measured:
    100 iterations here cost ~55s — chance-node construction cost doesn't
    scale linearly with iteration count the way that default assumed, so
    there's no reason to pay for a larger number nothing is tuned
    against). At demo scale (~33 combos, `max_raises=3`), real
    (not extrapolated) component measurements — one flop-level
    `build_chance_node(chain_to_river=True)` call: ~20.9s; one single
    river-level hop (one branch's populated `chance_fn`, invoked once):
    ~3.4s — combined with the realistic count of distinct turn-level
    showdown terminals a full flop tree would actually visit (~2,400,
    reasoning from M12's own 7-flop-terminal/49-branch numbers) imply a
    full demo-scale solve would cost **on the order of two-plus hours**
    just for river-level chance-node construction — even more decisively
    ruling out a live endpoint than M12's own 183-second flop→turn
    finding one milestone earlier. **Ships engine + tests only, no
    API/frontend slice, same as M12** — not a deferred-pending-
    measurement question this time, a confirmed one.

## Engine is standalone

`poker_solver/` has zero dependency on the API or any web framework — it's a
plain library usable on its own (`import poker_solver; poker_solver.solve_preflop(...)`).
This is enforced, not just true by convention: `tests/test_package_boundary.py`
scans every file under `poker_solver/` and fails the build if it ever imports
`fastapi`, `starlette`, `uvicorn`, or `api`. `api/` depends on `poker_solver`,
never the reverse.

Dependencies are split accordingly:
- `requirements.txt` — the engine only (`numpy`). `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  is enough to use `poker_solver` standalone.
- `requirements-api.txt` — adds the FastAPI backend (`-r requirements.txt` + `fastapi` + `uvicorn`).
- `requirements-dev.txt` — everything needed to run the full test suite (`-r requirements-api.txt` + `pytest` + `httpx2`).

## Workflow rules

- **Always work on a branch.** Never commit directly to `main`. Create a
  feature branch for every change, however small, and only merge into `main`
  when the user explicitly says to merge.
- **Tests are mandatory.** Every function gets a test.
  - Python: follow the `tests/` + pytest convention (one test module per
    source module, e.g. `poker_solver/foo.py` -> `tests/test_foo.py`).
  - Frontend: Vitest + React Testing Library, colocated as `*.test.ts(x)`
    next to the file it tests (e.g. `frontend/src/hands.ts` ->
    `frontend/src/hands.test.ts`).
- **Re-run the full suite after every change** — `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
  and, for anything under `frontend/`, `npm test` there too — before
  considering any change done, not just the tests for the file just touched.
- Ship one coherent improvement per PR (matches how this project started:
  scaffold -> missing-test PR -> merge).
